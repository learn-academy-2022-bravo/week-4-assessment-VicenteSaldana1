# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: In React, the word props stands for properties and it is specifically related to objects. It is my understanding that when working in React applications, everything is organized in classes and objects and in order to pass data from one class component into another, we must use props. 

  Researched answer: Props in React is just a shorter term for the keyword properties. Since React is a component-based library, those components need to communicate and send data to each other, and they do this by using props. 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is the computer's response to a user's action on a web page. Meaning, when a user clicks, changes, or hover's over an area with his mouse, that is called an action that the DOM automatically responds to. 

  Researched answer: A DOM event in React, refers to the ability of a web page to perform actions based on user events. React has similar events as HTML such as click and change. A key difference between the two is that React event handlers are written in CamelCase and inside curly brackets. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Objected Oriented Programming, also known as OOP, refers to a coding style that models its structure around data and objects. It is different than functional programming because it focuses primarily on creating reusable objects that can be used across programs. 

  Researched answer: OOP is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints usually called classes, which are used to create individual instances of objects. OOP is different than functional programming because of the three main concepts of classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer : The difference between a float and an integer in Ruby is that an integer is a whole number and a float is a decimal number. When working with numbers in Ruby, it is likely that the output will be more accurate by using a float than using an integer because integers produce an output that is rounded to the nearest whole number, not the exact value. 
  Example: in Ruby: 5 / 2 = 2    5 / 2.0 = 2.5 

  Researched answer: The key difference between a float and an integer in Ruby is that a float produces a more accurate value than an integer for the simple fact that when dealing with mathematical divisions, the value produced is rounded to the nearest whole number unless a float was used in the equation.  



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: This means that when working with methods in Ruby, there is not need to add the keyword return in order to get the value, as we did in JavaScript, because it will be automatically returned. 

  Researched answer: In Ruby, there is no need to include the keyword return when working with methods as we did in JavaScript because Rubyâ€™s methods will always return the result of the last evaluated expression.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: An instance variable is a type of variable that starts with an @ symbol. Example: @car. It is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming to give objects their own private space to store data.

2. PostgreSQL: A free and open-source object-relational database management system. It comes with many features that aim to help developers build applications along with administrators protect and manage data. I learned that with this program, you can define your own data types, build out custom functions, even write code from different programming languages without recompiling your database, which is really interesting. 

3. Ruby on Rails: An open-source web application framework that is commonly used today and is based on the Ruby programming language. It is an opinionated framework, which means that as a developer, you have to make less decisions because the creators of Rails already made them for you. This allows for more productivity and faster programming. 

4. ORM: Stands for Object Relational Mapping. It is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database through a library that implements this action. 

5. Active Record: In Active Record, objects carry both data and behavior, which operates on that data. It is an approach to accessing data stored in a database. This pattern is associated with ORM.
